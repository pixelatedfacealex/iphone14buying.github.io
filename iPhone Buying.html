    <h2><i>The latest and greatest iPhones:</i></h2>

    <h3>iPhone SE</h3> 

    <p>For those who are value-conscious and looking for an iPhone that can do basic iPhone needs for a reasonable price, the iPhone SE is perfect for those who don't really need the fancy features. The iPhone SE for $429, features the same design of the iPhone 8. But with a newer A15 chip and 5G, it's easy to breeze through tasks without any complaints. The iPhone SE also features a satisfactory camera, screen and battery that you expect well off from an iPhone. The iPhone SE's basicness and old design makes it suitable for younger audiences like new teens, older audiences like seniors an the elderly or even yourself, if you  crave something simple and cheap.</p>

    <h3>iPhone 14</h3> 

    <p>Like the iPhone 13, iPhone 14 brings little refinements to the table. Unlike the iPhone 13 with the iPhone 12 however, the iPhone 14 brings even less changes compared to the iPhone 13. The iPhone 14 still has the same A15 chip from the iPhone 13  and iPhone SE and the same iPhone 13 design, but without a sim card slot. However, the iPhone 14 does bring a few remarkable features for $799. It is the first iPhone to bring Emergency SOS via Satellite, the ability to get emergency help through satellite when cell towers are out of range. Also, the iPhone 14 features Action Mode for more video stabilization and the "Photonic Engine" for better image processing for photos.</p>

    <h3>iPhone 14 Plus</h3> 

    <p>The need for a big phone at a good price, having big hands or a big phone lover and above average battery life, the iPhone 14 is perfect for those. Apple this year decided to kill off its mini series for the return of the Plus. For a few years, the only way for iPhone users to get their hands on a big phone was to buy the most expensive Pro Max model. This time for $899, compared to $1099 for the Pro Max, you are saving $200 to experience the benefits of a bigger phone. Such as a bigger screen and a long 26 hour battery life.</p>

    <h3>iPhone 14 Pro + iPhone 14 Pro Max</h3> 

    <p>The best of the best, the latest and greatest, the need to get the best, the iPhone 14 Pro is the ultimate fit for those who need the best. Unlike the non-pro iPhones, the new iPhone 14 Pro's highlighted features is the new OLED display, with a 120 HZ refresh rate for smooth interaction and up to 2000 nits of brightness for the brightest display in an iPhone. The notch is replaced with a "Dynamic Island" that makes a camera holepunch zone, amusing and  interactable for notifications and controls. It also features the biggest camera leap in iPhone in 7 years, a new 48 MP camera system with autofocus and better stabilization. The iPhone 14 Pro has the brand new A16 chip with more efficiency over the A15 for better battery life, with the iPhone 14 Pro Max lasting 29 hours.

    <h2><i>Not enough iPhones? The new-ish iPhones:</i></h2>

    <h3>iPhone 12</h3> 

    <p>Squared off edges, 5G cellular first time in an iPhone, an OLED screen, a strong ceramic shielded screen, A14 chip and magnetic wireless charging with magnet accessories were the big hits of the iPhone 12, when it came out in 2020. Now this can be had for $599 new from Apple, $100 less than before. The iPhone 12 is perfect for those who want a modern-looking, fast iPhone at a slightly cheaper price. With modern iPhone features comforts like Face ID, 5G, 17 hour battery life, good camera, MagSafe magnet accessories and a phone sized not too big or small, you are not missing much by buying an older model.</p>

    <h3>iPhone 13</h3> 

    <p>Starting at $699, iPhone 13 brings little refinements and features to the table, rather than a big leap. It refines the previous iPhone 12 with a diagonal camera array, for sensor-shift stabilization for more stable pictures and videos. Cinematic mode, for movie-styled blurred videos and Photographic styles, new special filters for photos. The A15 chip brings more performance and efficiency than the A14, with 2 hours more of battery life compared to iPhone 12. The iPhone 13 is perfect for those who want something a little better than the iPhone 12, and are not willing to spend $799 on the newer iPhone 14, which is almost identical as the 13.</p>

    <h3>iPhone 13 mini</h3> 

    <p>The best small iPhone ever. For small hands, small phone lovers, people with small pockets and compactness is a priority, the iPhone 13 mini is a match. The newer A15 chip brings more efficiency and performance to the table, having the same battery life as the iPhone 12, while being smaller, faster, and double the base storage capacity of iPhone 12 while being the same price at $599.</p>
